## JavaScript Loops Lab

### Prerequisites

- JavaScript Fundamentals

### The Set Up

- You will need to create a new repository.
- Create new file called `Prompts.JS`
- Copy and paste prompts from lab into new file.
- Make sure to number the prompts you are answering in order to identify what is being answered.
- Complete the prompts below.

### The Task

Below are some prompts you will need to complete. You'll want to cancel out previous previous prompts as you complete each one so you can log it to the console for the output.

#### Loops

**Prompt 1:** Write a `for loop` that counts from 10 to 20, that prints each number to the console.

**Prompt 2:** Write a `for loop` that counts down from 40 to 0 that prints each number to the console.

**Prompt 3:** Write a `for loop` that counts from 0 to 20 in increments of 2 that prints each number to the console.

**Prompt 4:** Write a `for loop` that counts from -15 to 15 that prints each number to the console.

**Prompt 5:** Create a variable called `answer` and define it outside of your loop. Create a loop that counts from 20 to 30, incrementing by 2. Add i to `answer`. After your loop, print the value of `answer` to the console.

**Prompt 6:** This will require you to create a loop that counts from 0 to 30. Place a conditional statement inside of your loop with the following:

- If the value of `a` is even, print out "`a` is an even number".
- If the value of `a` is odd, print out "`a` is an odd number".

**Prompt 7:** Write a for loop that will iterate from 0 to 10. For each iteration of the for loop, it will multiply the number by 9 and log the result.

**Prompt 8:** Write a `do...while` loop that increments `i` by 2 as long as `i` is less than 20.

**Prompt 9:** Write a `while` loop that counts from 5 to 20 and prints each number to the console.

**Prompt 10:** Write a `while` loop to count from 20 to 0. Log each number to the console.

**Prompt 11:** Write a `while` loop that uses the `prompt` function that will continue to ask the user for the magic number until they enter the number 8.

**Prompt 12:** Write a `do while` loop that iterates at least once and reiterates until `i` is no longer less than 5.

## Submission

You will need to submit an issue on this repository.
